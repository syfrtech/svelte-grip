# Svelte Shadow

A library of tools that allow you to build totally-custom and accessible accordions, dialogs, modals, tooltips, and more in Svelte. Written exclusively in Typescript with documentation.

```html
<script lang="ts">
  let [dialog1$, dialog1] = useDisclosure();
  let [tooltip$, tooltip] = useTooltip();
</script>

{#if $dialog1$.isOpen}
<dialog open use:dialog1.content="{$dialog1$}">here is some content!</dialog>
{/if}
<button use:dialog1.button="{$dialog1$}" on:click="{dialog1.toggle}">
  click to open modal
</button>
<a href="#" use:dialog1.button="{$dialog1$}" on:click="{dialog1.toggle}"
  >this link will also open dialog1</a
>

{#if $tooltip$.isOpen}
<dialog open use:tooltip.content="{$tooltip$}">here is the tip</dialog>
{/if}
<span use:tooltip.trigger="{$tooltip$}">hover for info</span>
```

## Install

Add it to your Svelte / Svelte Kit project:

`npm install git+https://github.com/syfrtech/svelte-shadow.git `

Note: this version is: 0.0.1-alpha.8
(alpha/beta releases may have breaking changes without warning)

## Why headless / unstyled?

This allows you to get the functionality you want without being constrained to a particular design style. You can use Material UI, Bootstrap, Carbon, Tailwind, or plain-ole CSS if you like.

## Why no .svelte files?

This library is specifically designed not to constrain you to any particular implementation, so it doesn't rely on Svelte components directly. Instead, it uses `use:actions`, providing tools so that you can quickly build functionality.

## What about accessibility?

This library is intended to fulfill accessibility / a11y without the headache and documented with references. Even if you think you don't want/need accessibility, you still probably want it. For example:

1. Accessible content is easier for machine processing: that means better SEO, better automation, better device compatibility, etc
2. Your interface is keyboard friendlyðŸŽ‰. This makes your application more appealing to advanced users who are annoyed when having to drag their mouse all over a screen for no reason.
3. You get thoroughly vetted patterns: no need to reinvent the wheel.
4. You avoid wasting time with naming and inconsistencies (ex: no need to debate `class="modal" id="modal1"` vs `class="modal1"`)
5. Your application is accessible to those with impairments.
