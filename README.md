# Svelte Shadow

A library of tools that allow you to build totally-custom and accessible accordions, dialogs, modals, tooltips, and more in Svelte. Written exclusively in Typescript with documentation.

```html
<script lang="ts">
  let [dialog1$, dialog1] = useDisclosure();
  let [tooltip$, tooltip] = useTooltip();
</script>

<dialog open use:dialog1.content="{$dialog1$}">here is some content!</dialog>
<button use:dialog1.button="{$dialog1$}" on:click="{dialog1.toggle}">
  click to open modal
</button>
<a href="#" use:dialog1.button="{$dialog1$}" on:click="{dialog1.toggle}"
  >this link will also open dialog1</a
>

<dialog open use:tooltip.content="{$tooltip$}">here is the tip</dialog>
<span use:tooltip.trigger="{$tooltip$}">hover for info</span>
```

## Install

Add it to your Svelte / Svelte Kit project:

`npm install git+https://github.com/syfrtech/svelte-shadow.git `

Note: this version is: 0.0.1-alpha.8
(alpha/beta releases may have breaking changes without warning)

## How it works

1. You import an action you want to use. ex: `let [tooltip$, tooltip] = useTooltip();`
2. You add the action to the element(s) that will use that action. ex: `<span use:tooltip.trigger="{$tooltip$}">hover for info</span>`
3. The action injects the necessary functionality into your element. For example, the `span` above, would register the events to track mouseover and focus to toggle the tooltip content.

Note: reactive values have a `$` suffix to indicate their reactiveness (ex: `dialog1$`). You can subscribe to them with the `$` prefix, so they end up looking like `$dialog1$`

## Transitions / Animations

It's actually quite easy! Although may a11y patterns do not account for transition animations, we can add this behavior with Svelte. For example:

```html
{#if $dialog1$.isOpen}
<dialog
  transition:fade="{{delay: 250, duration: 300}}"
  open
  use:dialog1.content="{$dialog1$}"
>
  here is some content!
</dialog>
{/if}
```

The nice thing here is that svelte-shadow does not interfere with Svelte. You can customize styling and animation transitions however you like using native Svelte syntax... which boils down to native HTML + JS ðŸ¤©!

## FAQ

### Why headless / unstyled?

This allows you to get the functionality you want without being constrained to a particular design style. You can use Material UI, Bootstrap, Carbon, Tailwind, or plain-ole CSS if you like.

### Why no .svelte files?

This library is specifically itended to avoid straightjacketing you to any particular implementation; it doesn't rely on Svelte components directly. It can be tempting to create the functionality (like React), but we _resist the temptation_! Instead, we use `use:actions` to provide tool access. From there, you are welcome to extend your elements as Svelte components or additional actions as you see fit.

### What about accessibility?

This library is intended to fulfill accessibility / a11y without the headache and documented with references. Even if you think you don't want/need accessibility, you still probably want it. For example:

1. Accessible content is easier for machine processing: that means better SEO, better automation, better device compatibility, etc
2. Your interface is keyboard friendlyðŸŽ‰. This makes your application more appealing to advanced users who are annoyed when having to drag their mouse all over a screen for no reason.
3. You get thoroughly vetted patterns: no need to reinvent the wheel.
4. You avoid wasting time with naming and inconsistencies (ex: no need to debate `class="modal" id="modal1"` vs `class="modal1"`)
5. Your application is accessible to those with impairments.
